# seng6245-intro-examples

This project contains code examples to go with the intro lecture in SENG 6245. You should be able to just clone the
repository then import the project into Eclipse. Please make sure you are using Java 8 (JDK 1.8), we aren't using
any features specific to Java 8 in this example, but that is the current version so we will be using that in the
course.
